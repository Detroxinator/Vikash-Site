    <p>Fullmetal Alchemist (Japanese: 鋼の錬金術師, Hepburn: Hagane no Renkinjutsushi) is a Japanese anime television series
        loosely adapted from the original manga series of the same name by Hiromu Arakawa. Comprising 51 episodes, it
        was co-produced by the animation studio Bones, Mainichi Broadcasting System (MBS), and Aniplex and directed by
        Seiji Mizushima. It was broadcast on MBS in Japan from October 2003 to October 2004.

        As in the manga, the series follows the adventures of brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric, who are searching for
        the Philosopher's Stone so they can regain the bodies they lost in a failed attempt to bring their dead mother
        back to life. During production, Arakawa requested an original ending for the anime that differed from the
        manga, which was still ongoing at the time. This led to the series deviating into an entirely original storyline
        direction halfway through its run. The first anime series concluded with a direct sequel film, Conqueror of
        Shamballa, released in 2005. A second anime series, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which faithfully adapted
        the entire storyline of the original manga, was broadcast in 2009.</p>
